Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and
improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that
can access data and use it learn for themselves. Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that
computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference
instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data,
known as training data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine
learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop
an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses
on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the
field of machine learning. Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through
unsupervised learning. Machine learning and artificial intelligence share the same definition in the minds of many however, there are some
distinct differences readers should recognize as well. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as
predictive analytics.
